    "**Abstract:** Collection agencies spends millions of dollars sending letters and making phone calls in order to potentially receive some sort of payment from the debtor. Most of these companies are blindly sending letters and making phone calls to make an effort to retain some form of payment. Data science will be applied in attempt to increase right party contact, filter and prioritize accounts, therefore increasing collection efficiency and decreasing operational cost. \n",

    "**Example:** mailing 500k (arbitrary account numbers) letters to pre-screened individuals, who have a higher likelihood of paying vs. mailing letters to all 2 million individuals. At \\\\$0.15 a letter, total cost of \\\\$300k, which will save the company \\\\$225k or 75% every time they plan on mailing a letter. Same can be applied with phone calls. \n",

    "1. Can we use machine learning to segment and rank accounts by likelihood of payment using historical accounts? \n",

    "2. Can we identify the best method of outreach (call, letter, email, ect.) for each account using historical successes? \n",
